# ðŸ“Š SQL Data Analysis Project â€“ Book Sales Dataset

In this project, I explored and analyzed a fictional book sales dataset using **PostgreSQL**.

The dataset includes three tables:
- **books**: book details, genre, price, stock
- **orders**: customer orders with quantity, order date, and total amount
- **customers**: customer information

I wrote SQL queries to answer both **basic** and **advanced** business questions, practicing real-world data analysis techniques.
